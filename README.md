# Data Structures and Algorithm

Hi I'm Thao, I have been working as a Java developer for more than 2-year but I think my skills in data structures and alorithrm not good so I create this repository to improve my skills about it. 
If you are have the same problem, let's create a repository like this and start to learn today to improve your skills and also your salary.
* You have to resolve asleast one problem a day and push to your repository.
* If you missed a day then the next day you must complete 2.
Then, see how you changed day by day.
I want to be a red in codefores. Let's see that I can or can't.

Thank you for reading this.
    Thao
